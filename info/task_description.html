    On the island Stephen discovered the old house. After exploring,
    he found that the house has 16 ( 4x4 ) rooms.
    Each room has four doors, but some doors are closed and outer doors lead into the unknown.
    The only exit from the house is the north door in the 1st room.
    When he was in the last room (#16) he heard a strange sound.
    With the help of his sensors he recognized that in the first room (#1) appeared a ghost.
    You should help Stephen get away from the house.
    To do this, he needs to get into the first room (#1) and does not meet the ghost.

<p>
    Stephen can move at four directions: north, south, west and east ("N", "S", "W", "E")
    if doors are not closed for these directions. Stephen is scared and can not stand still.
    Also don not try to move in outer door -- the only way out of the house is the northern door in 1st room.
    On each step you should return a direction as a letter, where you want to move Stephen.
    After your step, the ghost makes its move. The ghost know where is Stephen and trying to catch him.
    It move by the shortest way to Stephen, but it is little dumb and using Euclidean distance for choice direction.
    The ghost is always moving it can not stand still too.

<p>
    On the each step you are given three arguments:
    the map of the house, Stephen's location (room's number) and Ghost's location (room's number).
    The map is represented as a list with 16 elements, where each element corresponds to a room (1st element -- 1st room).
    Each element of the list is a string with closed directions.
    For example: If 6th element (index 5) is "NS", then in the 6th room the north and south doors are closed.<br>
    Be careful: Outer doors are always open. You should exit only in the north door in the 1st room.
